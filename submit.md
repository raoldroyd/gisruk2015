Call for papers
===============

We welcome colleagues to the 23rd GIS Research UK (GISRUK) conference. The GISRUK conference series
is the UK's national GIS research conference, established in 1993. GISRUK conferences attract
delegates from all parts of the UK, together with the European Union and North America and from
disciplines including Geography, Computer Science, Planning, Archaeology, Geology, Geomatics and
Engineering.

[#GISRUK2015](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23GISRUK2015&src=typd) will be
hosted by the University of Leeds' esteemed School of Geography in the Faculty of Environment. The
conference will take place on the 15th - 17th April 2015.

Abstract Submission
-------------------

We invite submission of extended abstracts (up to 1500 words). All abstracts will be peer reviewed;
accepted abstracts will be published in the conference proceedings and some will have the
opportunity to be written up as full papers and submitted to a special issue of *Applied Spatial
Analysis and Policy*.

We also invite the submission of posters. These will be displayed during the conference and there
will be a special poster session for authors to briefly present their poster.
